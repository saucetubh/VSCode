Compile Time Polymorphism - also called static binding, via method overloading (same method name with different parameters) 
and also operator overloading (same operator with different data types). We get to know whethter it is valid or not at compile time.
Run Time Polymorphism - also called dynamic binding, via method overriding (same method name with same parameters in parent and child class).
Functions cannot be overloaded by return type alone. We get to know whethter it is valid or not at run time. (Example - inheritance is a run time property)
